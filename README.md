# FPSSample :video_game: 


## Motivation :space_invader: 
This is a Simple project that I'm building to learn more about FPS games and to learn some 3D modeling and shader development. Currently the project is on development on its Early stages but I'll encorage you to take a look at the [Scripts](./NotSoFarWest/Assets/Scripts) session if you are interested on seeing how it the project architectured.

You can also play a sample of the lastest build [Here](https://arthurobdfv.github.io/FPSSample), I'll be constantly updating both the source code and the build page so you can check the latest implementations.

## Technologies Used :rocket:
* [Unity](https://unity.com/) - Game engine used to build and develop the game;
* [C# / .NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) - The programming language I'm most confortable using and the main language or the Unity game engine;
* [GitHub](https://github.com) - My source control tool and also really good to let the project [Live](https://arthurobdfv.github.io/FPSSample)
* [Trello](https://trello.com) - Task tracking source, I also use a notebook and a pencil to keep things organized :)

## Source Code :computer:
* [Scripts](./NotSoFarWest/Assets/Scripts) - Scripts Session with code explanation and project architecture;
* [Play Live](https://arthurobdfv.github.io/FPSSample) - Play this game directly from the Browser! I'll be constantly updating it.
